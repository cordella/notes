Cordella's Notes
================

Things observed during testing that I feel are interesting enough to publish.

1. [Class vs. Dictionary; or, An Example of Spaceâ€“Time Tradeoff in Python][Py:CvD]
2. [Notes on Python division][Py:DIV]
    * [Multiplicative inverse, i.e. computing 1/*x* for a given *x*][Py:DIV:INV]
